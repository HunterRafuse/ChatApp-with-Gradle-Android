# ChatApp-with-Gradle-Android
A react-native application created for Android devices.

## ChatApplication with Gradle first steps:
So let's dive right in! Before gradle came about, developers created applications with Eclipse which nine times out of ten most developers didn't build an APK(Android Application Package) without Eclipse. Instead of having to maticulously implement CMD code to create an application with jargon such as dx and aapt that derives from within the SDK(software development kit)Gradle is implemented by Android Studio. Which creates an exact foundation for your android application without the hassle of creating specifications on your own which in turn makes meeting deadlines faster and less stressful. With little to no knowledge about Android Development in general, this little language called Gradle can set you on the path to creating complex and amazing web apps. So let's begin by downloading the Link <a href="https://www.google.fi/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjT4aL3-q_aAhUEP5oKHWNGA_IQFggoMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.android.com%2Fstudio%2Findex.html&usg=AOvVaw3Sc79X2kzVV5Vj7s0ljRel"> here</a>.

It makes things a lot easier when you take a look at the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/intro/index.html">Docs</a> and the latest <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/index.html">release notes</a> just to make sure that any syntax changes or new syntax for example is known and understood before moving on. A quick skim is great, if not just save it for later. So after we have that downloaded let's install the Android Studio Application and when it's finished we should see a pop up like so:
